**Medical-Services-and-Medicine-Matching-Project**

In this project, you developed a system that processes patient visit data to extract 
and match relevant medical services and medicines from unstructured text.
The input data included CSV files for services and medicines, along with patient records in an Excel file.
The system identifies matches, converts them to uppercase,
and saves the results in a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.
